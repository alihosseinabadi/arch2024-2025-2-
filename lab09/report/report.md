# Work Goal

Acquiring skills in writing programs using subroutines. Familiarization with debugging methods using GDB and its main capabilities.

# Assignment

1. Implementation of subroutines in NASM
2. Debugging programs using GDB
3. Independent completion of tasks based on the materials of the laboratory work

# Theoretical Introduction

Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in a program. In general, it can be divided into four stages:

* Error detection;
* Locating the error;
* Determining the cause of the error;
* Fixing the error.

The following types of errors can be distinguished:

* Syntax errors — detected during the compilation of the source code and are caused by a violation of the expected form or structure of the language;
* Semantic errors — are logical and lead to the fact that the program starts, runs, but does not give the desired result;
* Runtime errors — are not detected during compilation and cause the program execution to be interrupted (for example, these are errors related to overflow or division by zero).

The second stage is finding the location of the error. Some errors are quite difficult to detect. The best way to find the place in the program where the error is located is to break the program into parts and debug them separately from each other.

The third stage is determining the cause of the error. After determining the location of the error, it is usually easier to determine the cause of the incorrect operation of the program.
The last stage is fixing the error. After that, when the program is restarted, the next error may be found, and the debugging process will start again.

# Performing Laboratory Work

## Implementation of Subroutines in NASM

I create a directory for performing laboratory work No. 9 (Figure 1).

![Creating a working directory](image/1.png){#fig:001 width=70%}

I copy the code from the listing into the file, compile and run it. This program performs the calculation of the function (Figure 2).

![Running the program from the listing](image/2.png){#fig:002 width=70%}

I change the program text by adding a subroutine to it. Now it calculates the value of the function for the expression f(g(x)) (Figure 3).

![Changing the program of the first listing](image/3.png){#fig:003 width=70%}

Program code:

```nasm
%include 'in_out.asm'

SECTION .data
msg: DB 'enter x: ', 0
result: DB '2(3x-1)+7=', 0

SECTION .bss
x: RESB 80
res: RESB 80

SECTION .text
GLOBAL _start
_start:
mov eax, msg
call sprint

mov ecx, x
mov edx, 80
call sread

mov eax, x
call atoi

call _calcul

mov eax, result
call sprint
mov eax, [res]
call iprintLF

call quit

_calcul:
push eax
call _subcalcul

mov ebx, 2
mul ebx
add eax, 7

mov [res], eax
pop eax
ret

_subcalcul:
mov ebx, 3
mul ebx
sub eax, 1
ret
```

### Debugging Programs Using GDB

I copy the program from the second listing into the created file, translate it with the creation of a listing and debugging file, link and run it in the debugger (Figure 4).

![Running the program in the debugger](image/4.png){#fig:004 width=70%}

Having run the program with the `run` command, I made sure that it works correctly (Figure 5).

![Checking the program with the debugger](image/5.png){#fig:005 width=70%}

For a more detailed analysis of the program, I add a breakpoint to the `_start` label and run the debugging again (Figure 6).

![Running the debugger with a breakpoint](image/6.png){#fig:006 width=70%}

Next, I look at the disassembled code of the program, translated into a command with Intel syntax (Figure 7).

The differences between ATT and Intel syntax are in the order of operands (ATT: source operand first; Intel: destination operand first), their size (ATT: explicitly specified with suffixes; Intel: implicitly determined by context), and register names (ATT: preceded by '%'; Intel: without prefixes).

![Disassembling the program](image/7.png){#fig:007 width=70%}

I enable pseudo-graphics mode for easier analysis of the program (Figure 8).

![Pseudo-graphics mode](image/8.png){#fig:008 width=70%}

### Adding Breakpoints

I check in pseudo-graphics mode that the breakpoint is saved (Figure 9).

![Breakpoint list](image/10.png){#fig:009 width=70%}

I set another breakpoint at the instruction address (Figure 10).

![Adding a second breakpoint](image/10.png){#fig:010 width=70%}

### Working with Program Data in GDB

I view the contents of the registers using the `info registers` command (Figure 11).

![Viewing the contents of registers](image/11.png){#fig:011 width=70%}

I look at the contents of the variables by name and by address (Figure 12).

![Viewing the contents of variables in two ways](image/12.png){#fig:012 width=70%}

I change the contents of variables by name and by address (Figure 13).

![Changing the contents of variables in two ways](image/13.png){#fig:013 width=70%}

I output the value of the `edx` register in various formats (Figure 14).

![Viewing the register value in different representations](image/14.png){#fig:014 width=70%}

Using the `set` command, I change the contents of the `ebx` register (Figure 15).

![Examples of using the set command](image/15.png){#fig:015 width=70%}

### Processing Command-Line Arguments in GDB

I copy the program from the previous laboratory work to the current directory and create an executable file with a listing and debugging file (Figure 16).

![Preparing a new program](image/16.png){#fig:016 width=70%}

I run the program in debug mode specifying arguments, specify a breakpoint and start debugging. I check the operation of the stack, changing the argument of the command to view the `esp` register to +4 (the number is determined by the system's bit depth, and a void pointer occupies 4 bytes); an error with the argument +24 means that the input program arguments have ended. (Figure 17).

![Checking the stack operation](image/17.png){#fig:017 width=70%}

## Independent Work Assignment

1. I change the program of the independent part of the previous laboratory work using a subroutine (Figure 18).

![Modified program of the previous laboratory work](image/18.png){#fig:018 width=70%}

Program code:

```nasm
%include 'in_out.asm'

SECTION .data
msg_func db "Функция: f(x) = 10x - 4", 0
msg_result db "Результат: ", 0

SECTION .text
GLOBAL _start

_start:
mov eax, msg_func
call sprintLF

pop ecx
pop edx
sub ecx, 1
mov esi, 0

next:
cmp ecx, 0h
jz _end
pop eax
call atoi

call _calculate_fx

add esi, eax
loop next

_end: 
mov eax, msg_result
call sprint
mov eax, esi
call iprintLF
call quit

_calculate_fx:
mov ebx, 10
mul ebx
sub eax, 4
ret

```

I correct the found error; now the program correctly calculates the value of the function (Figure 20).

![Verification of corrections in the program](image/19.png){#fig:020 width=70%}

Modified program code:

```nasm
%include 'in_out.asm'

SECTION .data
div: DB 'Result: ', 0

SECTION .text
GLOBAL _start
_start:

mov ebx, 3
mov eax, 2
add ebx, eax
mov eax, ebx
mov ecx, 4
mul ecx
add eax, 5
mov edi, eax

mov eax, div
call sprint
mov eax, edi
call iprintLF

call quit
```
